## Python Junit - Saksham:

#### Adv: 
- Code will become more cleaner. 
- Unit test should be faster and should not include file operations and api calls. 
- Mock module we can use to mock file operations and api calls. 

#### TTD: 
- write first test cases. 

Setup method runs everytime before the test case. 
def setUp(self):

python selenium and cucumber  for website functionalities. 

#### course 
1) python unittesting on pluralsight. 
2) Already built project rewrite in TTD. 

python -m nose (To run all unittesting)
python -m nose --with-coverage for coverage.
